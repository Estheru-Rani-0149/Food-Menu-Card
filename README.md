🧾 Menu Card Feature
In addition to the Recipe Book, I’ve created a stylish Menu Card to showcase the food items offered at my restaurant along with their prices.

🍴 This Menu Card includes:

📋 A clean and modern design layout

💰 Price listing for each food item

🍕 Categorized dishes (e.g., Starters, Main Course, Desserts, Drinks)

✨ CSS styling to enhance readability and user experience

📱 Mobile-responsive layout using Flexbox/Grid

💡 Why I Built It
The Menu Card was created to:

Practice HTML structuring and semantic tags

Enhance UI design using pure CSS
